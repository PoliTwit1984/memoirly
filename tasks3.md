# Current Error
Unable to resolve module `expo-font/build/server` from `/Users/joewilson/PythonProjects/tribez/frontend/tribez-mobile/node_modules/expo-router/build/static/renderStaticContent.js`

# Steps Completed
1. Killed all running frontend and backend services
2. Restarted backend service successfully
3. Attempted to fix navigation setup:
   - Installed @react-navigation/native and @react-navigation/native-stack with correct versions
   - Created basic App.js with navigation configuration
4. Installed @expo/metro-runtime for web support

# Current Issues
1. The expo-router is trying to use server-side components of expo-font which aren't available
2. Web bundling is failing due to missing dependencies

# Next Steps Needed
1. Need to either:
   a. Install the correct version of expo-font that includes server components
   b. Or disable server-side rendering for the web version
2. Update the expo configuration to properly handle web platform
3. Resolve any remaining dependency conflicts
4. Test the application on both mobile and web platforms
